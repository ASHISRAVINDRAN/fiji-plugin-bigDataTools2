# BigDataConverter

Big image data comes in different formats and, due to the big (TB) size, both inspection and conversion from one format into another is a real issue. One issue is that loading the entire data set into RAM is not possible and a second challenge is that re-saving in a different format can take a lot of time.

The BigDataConverter plugin aims to facilitate efficient visual inspection and re-saving of big image data.
